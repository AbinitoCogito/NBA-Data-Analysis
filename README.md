# About NBA Players dataset

The dataset contains over two decades of data on each player who has been part of an NBA teams' roster. Each of player has variables such as height, weight, age, draft year, draft round, the team where he played, some average statistics like points, assists and rebounds, shoot efficency percentage , net rating etc. The dataset has got no missing value except college column. 


# About Exploratory Data Analysis

First part of this project starts with descriptive statistics about the dataset. Specifically, there will be filtered players like LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and their basic statistics. After that, there will be Data Preprocessing above the analysis. Moreover, this Data Preprocessing part includes Missing Value Analysis so that one able to learn more about the dataset. Aftermath, there will be splitted datasets into Eastern Conference teams and Western Conference teams in order to comparing their average statistics such as points, assists and rebounds. The next action is Feature Engineering so that add on new findings and discover new pattern if there any. 


In the final part, there will be splitted data into three categories that are called 'Isolation and Mid Range Dominence Era', 'Defense Strategy and Analitics' and '3-Point and Positionless Game Era'. Thus, one can see the difference these three different eras with various graphics. I organized these graphs into Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis sections.
